# Enforce consistent line endings for text files in this repo
# This helps avoid diffs/warnings about LF <-> CRLF on Windows vs Unix systems

# Let Git decide which files are text and normalize them to LF in the repo
* text=auto

# Force LF for common web/dev text files
*.php text eol=lf
*.html text eol=lf
*.css text eol=lf
*.js text eol=lf
*.json text eol=lf
*.sql text eol=lf

# Binary files should be marked as binary so Git won't try to convert them
